                Privacy Concerns:
            </b>
            </li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google‚Äôs Tracking:</strong> Google collects an enormous amount of data <br>
                 on its users. While this data helps improve services like Google Now and targeted ads, <br>
                 it also means your online activities are extensively tracked.
            </li>
             <li><b>Privacy Alternatives:</b> If you value privacy, consider using search engines <br>
                 that prioritize user privacy, such as DuckDuckGo. These alternatives don‚Äôt <br>
                 track your searches or build detailed profiles about you.

                Resource-Hungry Browser:
            </b>
            </li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Google Chrome:</b> If you‚Äôre using Google Chrome as your web browser, <br>
                 be aware that it can be resource-intensive, especially when it comes to RAM usage. <br>
                 Chrome has a reputation for gobbling up system resources.
            </li>
            <li>
