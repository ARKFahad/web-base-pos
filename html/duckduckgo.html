    <p>If privacy is your top concern, DuckDuckGo is a search engine worth considering. Here are several reasons why it stands out:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>
                No Tracking or Data Storage:
            </b>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unlike Google, DuckDuckGo doesn’t store your browsing data or track your online activities. Your search history remains private, and your IP address stays hidden.
            </li>
            <li>
                No more personalized ads following you around the web based on your search history
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <b>
                Block Online Trackers:
            </b>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Online trackers are pervasive—they collect data on your interests and behavior across websites. DuckDuckGo identifies and blocks these trackers from sites like Google and Facebook.
            </li>
            <li>
                You’ll get a fuller picture of how your data is being used, and your internet habits won’t be used to identify you
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <b>
                Fewer Ads:
            </b>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When you search with DuckDuckGo, you’ll encounter fewer ads overall. Unlike Google, which often displays ads in search results, DuckDuckGo keeps it clean.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plus, because it blocks online trackers, those pesky ads won’t follow you around the web after your initial search
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <b>
                Privacy-Friendly Practices:
            </b>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                DuckDuckGo doesn’t use cookies to track you across the internet. It’s all about respecting your privacy.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <b>
                HTTPS Everywhere and More:
            </b>
        </li>
        <ul>
